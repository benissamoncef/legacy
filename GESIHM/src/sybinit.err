The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load localization files!!
One or more following problems may caused the failure

Your sybase home directory is /produits/sybase15. Check the environment variable SYBASE if it is not the one you want!
Using locale name "fr_FR.iso88591" defined in environment variable LANG
Locale name "fr_FR.iso88591" doesn't exist in your /produits/sybase15/locales/locales.dat file
